Notes: Thursday evening: 
why is my grid not responsive right now? I'm caught on the column property, if I auto, it's responsive but will fill up alll
avaliable columns (all 9 images) so I need to set a maximum width they can shrink to before it has to reset. How do I do that? I have no idea. Good good.
